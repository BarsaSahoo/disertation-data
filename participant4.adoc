3. yes of course, By helping someone, I feel good from inside.
4. morning, because i Feel fresh in the morning to work, and gets time even after shift.
5. Night shift feels good, because there is a lot of time to work. But it doesn't feel good to wake up again and again in the night shift.
6. Yes, yes, I am doing by my choice, we should have experience of all shifts, what to do in which shift and what is the problem in which shift, all the staff should be aware of this.
7. yes, I don't know how the day ends.
8. We work far away from home, and we visit home once a year. Talks happen on the phone only after taking out time.
9. no, not much, If I am sleeping after coming from night shift and my roommate has evening shift and he is cooking food by playing song, I can't tell him anything because everyone has same situation, no one can enjoy because of shifts . That's why everyone has to adjust a little.
10. There is nothing like managing in the family. I live so far away, just talk in video call when it is off day. I go home once in a year, I am able to give only that much time, I am not able to see even the smallest event of the house, even if someone becomes ill, I am only able to do suggest them where to go what to do or i send money.
11. In married life, there will be distance from children due to duty. And there will also be some attachment and communication gap with wife and family if they live far away like us.
12. not much, its every 2nd day changing so we just have to be flexible.
13. sometimes in case if i could not sleep after my night shift because of some other work, then there is daytime sleepiness for one day but not more than that.
14. no, i sleep by 10:30 -11pm every night and get up by 5-5:30am next morning, the only disturbance in sleep timing is for those 2 days during night shifts. 
15. yes, in eating time there is huge disturbance because of changing shifts. specially during night shift in the morning I go to the room by 9 am and then after getting freshed up either I'll cook breakfast or go out to have something and i'll comeback and sleep by 10:30 or 11am so i'll skip lunch and directly have evening snacks again out for duty.
16. no, i never felt any hormonal problem in such.
17. no, we can't call it a psychological problem. sometimes when we have other disturbances in our personal life and we have night shifts there may be some mood swings.
18. no, not as such but sometimes when i'm trying to sleep and someone plays loud music, i get irritated. i get angry and restless.
19. n/a
20. According to me, after returning from duty in the morning, one should prepare more food and sleep after eating a little and should sleep comfortably till 4-5 pm. in the evening, one can heat the morning meal, eat and should leave for duty.
21. no, i don't think night shift can affect vigilance. On the contrary, I become more attentive in the night because there is fear, there are no consultants in the night.
22. no, i don't think.
23. no no, patient safety can't be disturbed. that is the 1st priority in work. 
24. no, i never had such experience.
25. no, there is no such major disturbance. little bit disturbances in eating and sleeping is manageable as we have only 2 night shifts per week.
26. no, i don't think there is any benefit.
27. no, if i will only seek to get day shifts then its not good, everyone should experience every shifts and also take rest, its anyways not that hectic to leave the job.
28. yes, It will make a difference, if I get more patients that I kept working the whole night, could not even sit for 1 minute, then there would be effect in work and also in health. That's why there should not be staffing like so much burden. staffing pattern for ICU at night shift Should be 1:2 or 1:3, there are more patients and if the condition of one patient is bad in the night, then the work of other patients will not be able to work.
29. Tea coffee is the best idea, we can take tea break in turn.
