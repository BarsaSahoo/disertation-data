1. done
2. yes, by my choice
3. yes im happy with my work.
4. i prefer  morning shift, because Due to waking up early in the morning, the body feels refreshed and Get time to rest after leaving duty. There is no problem in sleeping time, I get my personal time too.
5. Night shift is also good but Because the night shift is of 12 hours, so the body gets a little weak, Daily routine gets messed up, There is an off day after the night shift but it goes for sleeping and it does not seem to be an off day.
6. No, it is necessary to do 2 night shifts per week in the hospital, so it has to be done. If I had a choice, I would not have done the night shift.
7. Because the duration of time is so long, 12 hours, I get very tired and I feel sleepy and disturbed. Daily routine gets disturbed, I don't like night shift because of these issues. Yes, it seems like a short day, after going from duty, I am falling straight on the bed. it's noon when i wake up and then i'm having breakfast. It is not that I am doing duty only during working hours, here I am on duty even after my shift.
8. I am not able to give time, I am telling in clear language, I am not able to give time to anyone, neither to family nor to friends, Because when I am sleeping I am unable to talk, then I am cooking, doing my work, looking at the clock and then leaving for duty. But this is only the problem of those 3 days.
9. I am not married, I live with friends in hostel, the friends I have also have the same status as me, so no one can complain for time or participation. There is no such special effect. Until someone complains or blame, its effect is not known.
10. I don't have to balance anything like that because I tell on the phone that I will not be able to talk for 2-3 days, I am sleeping, night shift, etc. And they people understand, I manage them like this.
11. For those who are married, there may be some sourness in the relationship due to not being able to give time to each other. If both do not know well about each other's profession, then those people will not be able to balance lifestyle and behavior.
12. There are 2 night shifts in a week, so in the long term there is not much disturbance in the sleeping pattern. This is one benefit of this hospital i would say.
13. There is day time sleepiness after night shift, atleast for 2 days, sometimes plans have to be canceled because of that.And due to waking up 2 nights in a week, sleep is getting late day by day.
14. My circadian rhythm is no longer there, there was a time when I was a student, I used to fall asleep at 10-11 pm and also wake up at 6-6:30 am. Right now sleep time is getting delayed day by day, it has gone from 10 pm to 3 am now. Another thing is that I am getting phone addict, because I am looking at phone to stay awake at night and it is becoming a habit.
15. Too much, I am losing weight, the timing of food is not being maintained. Because there is duty from 8 in the evening to 8 in the morning, then I have to have dinner at 7 in the evening and after having dinner so early I am not able to sleep why I have to go to duty, I am awake then feel hungry at night If I am carrying tiffin too, then I am eating it even more at the wrong time. In the next morning of duty, going to the room, eating something and sleeping, then getting up in the evening after eating something and leaving for duty. Time is not manageable at all. Can't even eat 3 time meals properly.
16. NO, haven't felt any such hormonal issue yet.
17. No, no, I have never felt any psychological issues.
18. Yes, irritable mood definitely happens after night, if someone says something, sometimes I overreact or I start showing rude behavior, I have felt it.
19. n/a
20. There is no such thing as the best pattern of sleep, as I do not feel as relaxed by sleeping during the day as much as I do with sleep at night. All I can say is that a gap should be given in the middle of the night shifts.
21. No, I have never had problems with being attentiveness or being careful. Not in 1st night and not in 2nd night.
22. no no, Night shift has no effect on my performance, that means personally I have problems but there is no disturbance in work so far.
23. No, there is no harm in the safety of the patient, but it is the patients due to which the mind remains engaged in the work, if an emergency comes or the patient's condition deteriorates, then automatically we become alert and attentive, and how the night We don't even know it passes.
24. yet, i've never had any trouble in vigilance during night shift or because of the night shift.
25. weight loss is the major negative effect of doing night shift for me.
26. no, there is no benefit of doing night shift for me to be honest.
27. no no, It does not affect to such an extent that people leave the job and go away.
28. No, I think night shift has nothing to do with staffing pattern, because even if I get 3 patients, I will stay awake and even if I get 1 patient, I will not be able to rest why can't sleep in the ward because there is a big risk. 
29. But yes,  from the side of hospital management, if I could get a little something in the 2nd night for refreshment, because I would not prefer to rest, but if I had tea or coffee, it would have helped to stay awake. The family members of the nurse who lives with the family, must understand that sleep is very important for the health of the person and the family should respect his work and dedication and that respect and love can be shown by giving that nurse an appropriate environment, for Example, if there is any family discussion they can avoid it during night shift. They should avoid asking for time when the nurse's night shift is going on. these small things can help a nurse a lot.
