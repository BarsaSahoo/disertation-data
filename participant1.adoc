1. done
2. yes, by my choice
3. yes im happy with my work.
4. i prefer  morning shift, because Due to waking up early in the morning, the body feels refreshed and Get time to rest after leaving duty. There is no problem in sleeping time, I get my personal time too.
5. Night shift is also good but Because the night shift is of 12 hours, so the body gets a little weak, Daily routine gets messed up, There is an off day after the night shift but it goes for sleeping and it does not seem to be an off day.
6. No, it is necessary to do 2 night shifts per week in the hospital, so it has to be done. If I had a choice, I would not have done the night shift.
7. Because the duration of time is so long, 12 hours, I get very tired and I feel sleepy and disturbed. Daily routine gets disturbed, I don't like night shift because of these issues. Yes, it seems like a short day, after going from duty, I am falling straight on the bed. it's noon when i wake up and then i'm having breakfast. It is not that I am doing duty only during working hours, here I am on duty even after my shift.
8. I am not able to give time, I am telling in clear language, I am not able to give time to anyone, neither to family nor to friends, Because when I am sleeping I am unable to talk, then I am cooking, doing my work, looking at the clock and then leaving for duty. But this is only the problem of those 3 days.
9. I am not married, I live with friends in hostel, the friends I have also have the same status as me, so no one can complain for time or participation. There is no such special effect. Until someone complains or blame, its effect is not known.
10. I don't have to balance anything like that because I tell on the phone that I will not be able to talk for 2-3 days, I am sleeping, night shift, etc. And they people understand, I manage them like this.
11. For those who are married, there may be some sourness in the relationship due to not being able to give time to each other. If both do not know well about each other's profession, then those people will not be able to balance lifestyle and behavior.
12. There are 2 night shifts in a week, so in the long term there is not much disturbance in the sleeping pattern. This is one benefit of this hospital i would say.
13. There is day time sleepiness after night shift, atleast for 2 days, sometimes plans have to be canceled because of that.And due to waking up 2 nights in a week, sleep is getting late day by day.
14. My circadian rhythm is no longer there, there was a time when I was a student, I used to fall asleep at 10-11 pm and also wake up at 6-6:30 am.
