2. yes
3. yes i'm happy.
4. morning, i get full afternoon for me after that shift.
5. night shift is of 12hours so its little difficult.  as i have to have my dinner by 7pm and stay awake for entire night then i'll reach my room after shift by 9am next morning, its little tough.
6. yes, if there will be option of choosing shift, then also i'll sometimes choose to do night shift but not every week.
7. yes the days after night shifts are very short, i go back from shift and sleep for whole day and the day ends. it makes life short.

9. yes, in participating with friends is difficult with shift work.
10. i maintain my family relations by calling them positively on my off days and other shifts like morning and evening.
11. a
12. v
13. no, other than the next mornings of night shifts, i never had day time sleepiness.
14. no i didn't had such sleep awake fix time for sleeping so i don't have problems regarding that.
15. yes, because i have to eat by 7pm during night shift and i feel hungry in midnights so i carry tiffin boxes and eat late night i get time. that makes me many times sick and i have vomiting and acidity issues in next mornings because of that.

20. if i sleep at 1st half of the day just after leaving the shift, then only i'm able to complete my sleep. and i think we all need to complete atleast 8 hours of sleep before going for night shift.
21. no i don't think it can hamper in such way.
22. no, for me it didn't affected ever in my performance but yes when we go for getting vitals of patients they get disturbed they are stable saying, when we are trying to sleep you are disturbing.

26. no, i don't find any benefit of doing night shift.

28. yes, it increases work load for us. if patient is in ventilator or have syringe pump on then it should not be allocated more than 2. that will be the best pattern in ICU.
29. support from the hospital management would help in a way if they would provide little more than sufficient staff that, when patients are stable, sisters could take a nap break in turns while an extra staff would just keep eyes on that sister's patient, or if patients are so critical that one have to keep eyes on continuous on patient then management can avail us some refreshment like juice/cold drink during summer nights and coffee/tea during winter nights.
