2. no, it was my father's choice.
3. with my work and ability i'm happy.
4. morning, except for getting up early morning, i get more time for me after the shift. so i like this shift.
5. it is ok, but there is little problem, if patient's condition gets worsen during night its very difficult because i'll be running here and there inside ICU to find supporting equipments for patient and 1000s of new advices i'll have to follow that makes me really tired.
6. no, its rule here to do 2 night shifts per week.
7. yes, i feel tired and i sleep for half of the day during night shift and its of 12 hour so anyways it shortens my life.
8. yes, but not that serious.
9. yes, social life means with friends if we want to plan for an outing we can't because of different shifts everyone has.
10. just like that, by calling them when i get time like for in morning shifts i call them in evening
11. maybe it will be more difficult for them to manage.
12. sometimes i don't get sleep even after staying awake for whole night.
13. yes some times, if i couldn't sleep during the day after doing night shift, then next days i feel sleepy.
14. i didn't had any fix sleep awake time, so there is no such issues.
15. actually i feel hungry in time but because we can't eat on time, there is problem in appetite.
16. yes, the digestion issue i face the most.
17. no, not as such.
18. mood change happens because of tiredness due to lack of rest.  i become easily irritated for small reasons and anger issues are increasing.
19. yes, i face delayed periods mostly and i'm also consulting to gynecologist.
20. in 2nd half if i complete 6-7 hours of sleep, then its good for me to work in night shift.
21. yes it affects, because of our incomplete sleep we can't stay that attentive, there is chances of errors.
22. yes, i don't feel fresh or and comfortable to work.
23. if we won't be attentive the patient safety may get hampered with errors in our work.
24. yes, i have some experiences of trouble in vigilance, in the beginning i had maybe twice this error during night shift, i wrote the handover and by mistake i put those critical charts on the table of different patients.
25. there are many small difficulties i would not call those major, coz its manageable.
26. no, there is no benefit.
27. no, i don't think.
28. yes, poor staffing pattern makes night shift worse. best should be 1:2 in ICU.
29. sufficient staff should be maintained that will help a lot.
