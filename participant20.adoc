1. done
2. yes,
3. yes, i'm happy with my work
4. morning, i like the most because there will be consultants available to guide us.
5. it is ok, but its tough on 2nd night.
6. yes, because compared to other hospitals we are privileged and only have to work for 2 days in night while other hospitals asking for atleast 4 nights per week.
7. yes, for sure. only by 9am i reach my room after night shift and then daily activities and taking rest takes the entire day. i sometimes have headache also that disturbs in sleep even more.
8. we stay far from home, we can catch up with family only by phone and that 3days of we can't manage doing that either, so there is little problem because of that.
9. in social life there is not much difficulties, as i don't have much friends but i have some friends and i miss many planned events because my shift doesn't match with them. its last week only my friends went for movie and then shopping when i was staying room to complete my sleep as i had my 2nd night shift that evening.
10. There is nothing like balancing, actually here its either or situation. for my family life i don't have much trouble because they understand so we talk before and after night shifts but for social or even my personal interest to go out visit places are not possible because the only weekly off i get is after night shifts so either i can sleep and take rest or after working for 12 hours night shift go out and enjoy. its tough both ways.
11. in marriage life there will be many more problems i think. now i'm thinking about sleeping or going out, while after marriage the going out option i may not even keep as an option because there will be kids, husband, in laws and i think responsibilities towards family will be more and the need for rest will also increase by the time, its going to be very tough i guess.
12. i didn't had any sleep awake time for me so i won't complaint about sleeping pattern getting disturbed coz i already sleep late at night.
13. yes, day time sleepiness is my problem. like, once i went out with friends on my night off day and so during day i didn't took rest, at night i slept of course but the next whole day i was feeling dizziness and sleepy.
14. circadian rhythm was maybe good when i was kid, staying home with parents, back then mom will ask to go to bed by 10pm and next morning we have to wake up by 7 for school and all, but that got disturbed very early when i was graduating and staying in hostel with friends staying awake till late nights. so, i won't blame night shifts for disturbing my circadian rhythm.
15. yes, the time i'm hungry i won't have time to eat and by the time i'll be free my hunger would disappear. during night shift i feel hungry obviously as its 12 hours but just like last day i got a Tuberculosis patient so i couldn't even drink water whole night, i have to avoid food even if i'm hungry for many reasons.
16. yes, 1st major disturbance is digestion, because of eating in odd times and i have acidity and many other problems.
17. yes, sometimes its like i get irritated and feel like i'm just not happy because i can't have my own time as i wish.
18. on first night i get prepared to face that 12 hours night duty but on second night shift i can't manage to make my mind, i get stressed by just thinking about it and have headache, just like today, i have 2nd night shift and i already have headache.
19. yes, i get periods delayed or advanced by a week sometimes, mostly it gets delayed and gynac says its because of lack of sleep.
20. actually we should sleep at least for 5 to 6 hours before coming for work, but its really not possible for me, in my roommates also got night shift in same day by chance then its good that we all can sleep quite but when shifts are different they'll woke up when i'll return from my duty and they'll keep making noise coz they'll cook, do phone calls and i can't complaint because its same for them also when they have night shift.
21. yes, night shift can be very boring for some people as its a long 12 hours shift and if the person won't be careful enough there is chances of vigilance trouble.
22. yes, it do affect the performance, if i couldn't get good sleep during day because of any reason, it'll be very tough for me to be attentive in night shift because i have headache if i'm sleepless and with that my performance may not be that fine.
23. there is so much self control needed to perform night shift. the patient is here depended on us, we always have to keep our personal health issues out of reach to out patients. patient safety is most important to be attentive about during night shift as no one will be there even to notice and inform if there is anything wrong with patient.
24. yes, when there is pressure i had done silly mistakes which can really cause serious problems, and it only happens in night shifts because during night its only and only you who has to take care of everything. once i had 2 patients and one vacant bed at night, one of those patients was in ventilator i was already stressed and working continuous for both of the patients then on my vacant bed a new patient got admitted and was in serious condition that we had to put that patient in ventilator just then and all initial ICU profile works i had to do plus my old patients were there, that day i wrote hand over on the critical chart nicely but kept the papers on wrong patients table, it got exchanged by my mistake. so, it happens because there won't be any helping hand or guide during night even to catch our mistakes so night shift is very tough.
25. major problem is that in all other shifts we are working for 6 hours after that the time is ours we can do whatever we want after our shift, but for night shift 12 hours we are already in hospital and then we don't have any choice but to sleep, we can't even take time and cook something good. even after the duty is over i feel like we are under control of something.
26. no, i don't see any benefit of doing night shift, morning and evening shifts are much better than night shift.
27. i can't say about others leaving job but if i'll get a chance to avoid night shift and work only day shifts i'll definitely choose that. 
28. yes of course, its not only in night but also in morning shift staff shortage hampers a lot, yesterday i had morning shift and i was allocated for 5 patients, because now its christmas season and many staffs are on leave, one of my patient had medicine opinion so the physician came and was giving round and at the same time our surgeon came for rounds so i was really stressed about that and i had to call other colleagues to help me. staff should be available and ideally in ICU staff patient ratio should be 1:1 but its fine if its minimum 2 patients and maximum 3 patients per staff but not more than that.
29. in our hospital there is no special facilities for night shifts but many other hospitals where my friends are working provides at least mid night snacks and tea coffee are always available at nursing station. so, from our hospital management also i would ask for at least the same or only tea coffee maybe enough to help us staying awake at night.
