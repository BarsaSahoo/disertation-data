1. done
2. Yes, I am doing it of my own free will but admission in nursing was not done by my will. I wanted to do B.Ed, I wanted to become a teacher. I have thought of going into teaching after doing higher studies.
3. yeah, but not fully because i wanted to pursue something else.
4. evening shift, because i don't miss any of my meals during evening shift, in morning i have to miss breakfast and in night shift every meal will get disturbed and also our sleep.
5. night shift i don't like much and the 1st reason is because it's of 12 hrs, then sleep disturbance is there.
6. no, here its a rule to do 2night shifts per week that's why. actually initially night shift is not the main problem, the rotating shift is the problem that changes every 2nd day. if they would ask me to do 8 nights for a month in one go i'll do and stay relaxed for next 2 weeks of that month.
7. life becomes something which i can't explain to you, where the days goes during night shifts i can't sense, at night we are on duty during day i'm sleeping, there is day and night just for name.
8. i am not able to even talk in phone during night shift.
9. There is also disturbance in social life, I am not able to get involved in plans with friends. As it was Christmas gathering today, juniors had invited but could not go due to duty. and there are plans which i had to cancel just to sleep after a night shift.
10. when there is an off day, we could manage to talk on phone. other days we can't talk, means those long talks are not possible.
11. I think married people will have more problems because children will say that they have to talk to their father, if they want to meet, then there will be trouble. There is not much problem in single life.
12. Night shift is of 12 hours isn't it that's why there is less time in the day anyway, have to leave 1 hour before for duty and even after leaving by handover it becomes 1 hour, that means only one hour is available in the day, cook and eat in it Take bath, everything has to be maintained, then sleep also has to be completed. There is no sleeping pattern, nothing happens.
13. Only one off is available in the week, that too after the night, the whole week is not free, you can just plan anything on the night off, but if you do not sleep on that day, there will be burning in the eyes and sleep will be a lot. And because of that there will be daytime sleepiness.
14. circadian rhythm is not there anymore, because of frequently changing shifts. Today was my morning shift, I got up in the morning at 5:30 am, then the in-charge called and said that the staff in the evening shift is short, you come in the evening. I did not sleep after that, and now after evening, I will go back in the night, such is the disturbance of our sleep.
15. yeah, during night shift eating time is really disturbed. if i'm getting up for eating in during the day, sleep just goes away and i can't sleep after that. so i have to complete my sleep because i have to stay awake whole night. 
16. Speaking of hormonal disturbances, there is a problem in digestion, I get acidity a lot. I can't drink water during night shift, can't remember at night and the whole i'll be sleeping.
17. If we do clinical duty of psychological problems but by the end of 10 years, we will all have CKD.
18. The mood gets dull when the night shift is going on, there is irritability.
19. n/a
20. we should complete atleast 7-8 hours sleep, sometimes we still not feel active because at night works like writing handover again writing critical chart, these things are little boring stuffs which makes me even more lazy, giving medicine and giving rounds with doctors those works are interesting and we can't get distracted. 
21. yes, i had such experiences like i kept one patient's critical chart on the other patient's table. 
22. yes, at night some disturbance in our performance happens, like we can't perform as clear and actively as the day shifts.
23. yes all these minor mistakes can create big issues for patient.
24. for me i had paper exchanged of one patient with another.  
25. major negative effect for me is irritation in my eyes, i have vision problem and sensitivity to light.
26. no, there is no benefit of doing night shift.
27. yes, many people left this hospital and joined to some small clinics to get a general shift 9 to 5 job. even if i'll get a chance i'll go for day shifts.
28. yes of course, when a sister have 3 patients and unfortunately a new patient arrives and she got allocated for that, there will be a huge burden as we need to many initial things for new patient like checking vitals, history taking, physical examinations and all and again after RMO visits and gives advice, order and give 1st dose of all the medicines prescribed, making a new file and writing handover, sending blood sample for full ICU profile and having x-ray done. staffing pattern is must to be modified. best pattern will be staff patient ratio of 1:2 patients are with ventilator, syringe pump so it can't be handled, for neuro-surgery post-op patients it should be 1:1. 
29. hospital management should be serious about staff's health and comfort, they should atleast provide tea coffee or they should keep a canteen open here and staff should be more so that atleast everyone can take a break in turn.
