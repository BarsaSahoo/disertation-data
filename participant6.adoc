1. done
2. yes, i love my service.
3. yes, i'm happy and i always want to learn more.
4. morning, because we can discuss about the patient and the care plan with the consultant, its only possible in morning shift as there will be doctors round only once a day and that will be in morning shift. i always want to know all the why and how we are providing which type of care to the patient, there shouldn't be any doubt.
5. ok it is, as its 12 hour, its a very long shift so its little difficult in staying awake when patients are stable and we don't have any work to do after 12am to 2am, after that we start doing morning care of patients.
6. yes, i'm doing by my choice.
7. yeah it definitely feels like the day is being shorter because we have to manage food and also have to sleep.
8. no, not much i can manage.
9. i am a kind of person who don't like to go out much, so i never had such issues.
10. i am able manage by dividing time according to shifts for doing calls or visiting them.
11. no, i don't think night shift can affect married life, we have chose this profession and we have to be flexible and family members should also understand the time burdens. but if family is not understanding then there maybe issues.
12. yes, there is little disturbance in sleeping pattern. sometimes i'm able to sleep sometimes not, and because of staying awake in the nights i have issue in my eyes that get worse sometimes and i start having headache as well.
13. no no, i manage my time to complete sleep on the day after night shift and it can't affect my other shifts i always stay focused.
14. no no, only during 2 nights it won't be maintained but in long term there is no disturbance in circadian rhythm.
15. yes, little bit. we can't eat when we are hungry, it always either gets delayed or we have to eat advance to join a shift. but its manageable.
16. ha 
17. i never faced any psychological issues.
18. yeah little irritation i have during night shifts.
19. yes, i have delayed periods and that was because of incomplete rest and sleep.
20. we should complete atleast 6 hours sleep, i think that works for me.
21. no, i don't think.
22. no, its just a shift just like other shifts. i don't think it can affect anyone's performance.
23. no, night shift won't affect patient's safety.
24. no, never.
25. nothing such serious negative effect.
26. no such benefit is there, only thing is that we get more time and peaceful environment to work.
27. no, i don't think. i also won't leave my job because of night shift.
28. yes, because the patients' condition in ICU are very serious, according the patients' condition staffing pattern should be maintained. when patient is in ventilator or have frequent refilling syringe pump or hypoglycemic then its a serious matter and needs continuous supervision so only one patient should be allocated, or more else one stable patient can be allocated with the serious patient. staff patient ratio should not be more than 1:2.
29. staffing pattern should be increased if the hospital management will think about staffs health, because if there will extra helping staff, we can atleast take little break in turn. i don't want to sleep, that should be allowed but atleast someone to watch my patient for 15-20 minutes so that i can atleast head down on table and take a break and this also i want only when my patient is stable otherwise no need of even that break. in such situation if there will be tea or coffee just to help us staying awake and feel refresh, that would help a lot. we all just want staffs should have burden staffing pattern should be that flexible.
