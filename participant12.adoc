1. done.
2. yes.
3. yes, there little problem physically to me, but i'm happy with my work.
4. evening, because as compared to other shifts this one is most comfortable. in morning shift i have to wake up early morning and in night shift i have to stay awake whole night.
5. night shift is okay, it makes little problem because i have to have dinner earlier than other days and whole night we have to stay awake that's there. 
6. yes, its my choice. because i should also be aware of what are the situations in night shift to maintain a good grip in my work.
7. yes, the day after night shift is invisible because it goes only in sleeping and doing other works like bathing, cooking and laundry. we are working in a hospital so i can't skip bathing, nor the food and sleep as well.
8. no, i don't feel like it disturbs relations.
9. yes, once during durga pooja we had planned to go out with friends it was on my night off day and i came already late by 9:30 am and i was so tired because i had a really critical patient that night and i couldn't even sat whole night, that i had to cancel that plan and i just slept and also my friends got upset and went without me.
10. it varies individually, i manage time and call on other days.
11. married life will get more disturbance as compared to our single life.
12. sleep pattern remains ok but i have additional issues because i can't sleep during day.
13. no, not daytime sleepiness but i have fatigue for next 2 days,  because i can't sleep during day.
14. yes little bit sometimes, not always.
15. yes, there is disturbance in appetite and it makes my stomach upset. One more thing happens with me, this maybe because of weakness, I feel more inclined to eat sweets after night shift, which also can harm in long term.
16. not to me, but many of friends are having problem in their periods, mostly delay and irregular. many are loosing weight and some are gaining as well. 
17. no not as such.
18. little irritation happens sometimes, but mood swings gets worsen when we get our periods during night shifts.
19. menstrual cycle is getting affected for many, as i said some are getting irregular periods like dates of getting periods varies by 10-12 days, one of my friend sometimes gets twice a month.
20. best sleeping pattern would be i think to complete 6-8 hours of sleep, for me 4-5 hours is enough as i don't get sleep during day.
21. yes, i have heard it has happened with some people.
22. no, i don't think.
23. patient's safety can be affected from many ways like if someone could not stay awake or be attentive during night shift because of any reason, that can be very dangerous for a patient's life.
24. no, i never had such experience yet.
25. j
26. yes, during night there are many things which we can't learn during day shifts, such as what investigations comes under an ICU profile, ABG is only done compulsorily in the early morning everyday that we won't get much chance to learn during the day shift. one most important thing is to build and maintain IPR is best made during night shift by giving sponge bath, hair care, bed tiding for the patient. that bonding can't exist only by giving medicine. 
27. yes, people can leave i think also i have seen people. but actually there should be option to choose also in india like in other countries, that would be good so people can choose and can work happily.
28. yes, the work pressure increases when there is less staff. in ICU there should be maximum 2 patients allocated to 1 staff. if patients are stable then maybe 3 but not more than that.
29. actually there should be a nap break allowed in turns, that is important, if it doesn't hamper our work it may hamper one personally. in long term its unhealthy for anyone doing night shifts. emotional support from family and loved ones is really important and also we need to maintain a good diet.
