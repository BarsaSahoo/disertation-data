1. done
2. yes, it was my choice.
3. yes, i'm happy with my work.
4. morning shift i like most, After the morning shift, we get the whole afternoon, if there is any work then we can do it, can plan something with friends, can cook something good. we can get our personal time that's why.
5. to be honest, i don't like night shift much, because I am a fresher so staying awake all night has not become a habit for me yet. There is also another reason that there are no consultants in the night, so I get scared a little.
6. no, i'm doing night shifts just because it is compulsory to do atleast 2 night shifts every week. If I had a choice, I would not have done the night shift.
7. I do not have sleep during the day, and because of this reason, even after waking up all night, I am not able to complete my sleep during the day. Due to exhaustion, I am not able to do any other work also. Because after going from duty I have to sleep on the next day, so that day seems short because I used to sleep for half the time.
8. As I live in hostel, so I only talk on the phone with everyone, during night shift for 3 days, I do not talk to anyone, it is a problem. but still when my mother knows i'm going to stay awake whole nights for next 2 days even she gets tens for me.
9. Social life means, people who live with me here in my room sometimes get irritated due to night shift. Like if I had a night shift and I want to sleep during the day but my roommates do not have a night, they will cook or do something and because of that I will not be able to sleep but I cannot blame them because when their night shift When it happens, they also feel the same way, and no one does it intentionally.
10. I don't live with family but I feel that if I was with family, means my mother was here, atleast would cook food for me for 3 times, and thus I would be able to complete my sleep and After waking up, there was no tension of cooking and my mother would also be with me.
11. Married people will have a little more problem, they will have to see 2 families, and those who have children will have more problems because how do we expect children to understand our work, and if we give more priority to work than children then We are playing with the lives of our children. And anyway, in every family, every member has to do some work during the day, then at night there is such a time when the whole family gets to meet, sits together and talk or eat together.
12. Sleeping pattern is completely disturbed, because as today is day shift, so I will be able to sleep tonight but our shift changes frequently so no one specific sleeping pattern is maintained. One advantage of this is that we have to do every shift 2 times in a week, then we have to do only 2 nights, whereas in other hospitals we have to do full week nights.The sleeping pattern is disturbed not only because of the night but also because of the frequently changing shifts.
13. No no, I can't sleep during the day even after coming back from the night, and because of this, I have more problems.
14. there is nothing like a circadian rhythm for me right now, Rather, we have to find time to complete our sleep just by looking at the clock.
15. In the morning and evening shifts, I am able to eat 3 meals on time, just in the morning breakfast is a little disturbed but it is manageable if I come in the morning after drinking tea or coffee, but during the night shift in the morning I go to the room at 9 am and then after getting refreshed I cook breakfast or food and in that round it is 10-11 o'clock and sleep also goes away till that. After that, there is a problem in falling asleep, then if I fall asleep, I will wake up at 4-5 pm, then again cooking for dinner, after eating a little something, I have to leave again at 7 o'clock.
16. Hormones means there is a problem in digestion, I get disturbance in daily bowel movements.
17. no, i never had any psychological problem.
18. yes, little irritations some times i have felt.
19. no, in menstrual cycle i never noticed as such disturbance.
20. For people like me, i would say better than trying to maintain a sleeping pattern, meditating a little when you can't sleep will probably give you some relaxation, because you know that sleep is not complete.
21. It happens a bit as if there is a mistake in writing in the critical chart or the paper gets exchanged of any patient with other patients. Happened to me earlier, 1 time, I had exchanged the papers of both my patients, by mistake I had placed the patient's paper on that patient's table.
22. Doesn't affect anything in performance, but maybe if we don't come for duty after balancing our sleeping problems by being well prepared.
23. Yes it can, and for this we should be alert and responsible, because in our profession the night shift is necessary for the patients and we should understand this.
24. Yes, as once I had a paper exchange by mistake, if I had not seen it at the right time, then what a big inconvenience it could have been. There are so many differences in the condition of each patient, their vitals and intake output could have made them worse.
25. The major effect is that I get so busy balancing myself with the rotating shifts that I don't even get time to read anything, when I was an intern, it used to bother me a lot and that I will never forget. It seems that sometimes no other work can be done with the job where you have rotating shifts, if you want to do higher studies then you can do it by quitting the job.
26. no, i don't feel any benefit of doing night shift.
27. Yes, not the profession but people change jobs, more and more married people look for a general shift job. Even if I get such an option, then I will definitely suck the job of general shift.
28. Yes, in night shift we can not handle as many patients as morning, a sister can handle 3-4 patients in morning but not in night, because 10 pm medicine has to be given in night, mid night medicine also and 6am medicine too, then again in the morning every patient's sponge bath, mouth wash, grooming, bed tidying is to be done, there are so many extra work which is not to be done during the day including writing handover and making new critical chart. Therefore the staffing pattern should be different in the night shift.
29. There should be tea, coffee and some mid night snacks for the night shift, it would have been better, and the staffing pattern should also be changed, if there were extra helping staff, then the night staff would have been able to take a short nap.
