1. done
2. yes
3. yes i'm happy.
4. morning, because it's refreshing to work in the morning and i get time.
5. i don't feel good because its of 12 hours. 
6. yes, by my choice.
7. yes, days seems shorter when its next to night shift. 
8. no, for me i don't have disturbance in relationships.
9. no, i keep the duty in 1st priority, so there is no such disturbance. social life will bw there but career is the 1st thing to think about.
10. i will give time on the other half of the day, after or before my shift to my family that's all i can do. 
11. i don't have any idea about a married life.
12. in the beginning when i joined this job, i was so troubled to manage sleep awake timing in every second day changing shifts. but now i got balanced with this changing shift and i manage sleeping pattern differently in every shift.
13. yes, sometimes if i couldn't complete my sleep on my night off, i feel little sleepy during the next day.
14. yes, circadian rhythm can't be maintained for shift working people because our sleep time changes every 2nd day.
15. no, not that seriously. our eating time changes every day.
16. no, i never had such experiences.
17. not that evident i would say, but there is change in mood and little irritable my mood becomes during night shift maybe because of discomfort i feel due to incomplete sleep.
18. yeah, just that irritable mood for 2 days.
19. n/a
20. we should complete 8 hours of sleep, so that we can stay attentive atleast for half of the shift, then on we have to be involved in some activities otherwise we'll feel sleepy.
21. no, people are careful about this, when there is critical patient under me i will never feel sleepy because i'll be cautious about my patient.
22. no, i don't think it can affect my performance.
23. we become more careful when there is chance of deterioration in patient's condition, so i don't think night shift have to do anything with patient safety.
24. no, i never had such experience.
25. i don't have any problem with night shift which i can call major.
26. no, i don't think there is any benefit.
27. no, i don't think.
28. yes pressure increases if allocation increases. maximum should be 3 when patient's are stable, 2 patients when one is critical and one is stable, not more than that.
29. hourly we have to check vitals so we can't take break for more than 30 minutes. but if there will be extra staff to supervise then there is chances of taking nap break of 30 minutes in turn when the supervising staff can keep eyes on patient.
