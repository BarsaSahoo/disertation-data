26. no, there is no such benefit of doing night shift but yes Night off helps when we take a long leave, if we take it after night off, then we get an extra leave.
27. yes, people can leave.
28. yes, when there is staff shortage its very difficult to work at night in ICU. staff should be always sufficient and the allocation should be fixed for the patient with specific staff, we should not change the allocation of the patient to new staffs who don't know the patient's conditions from initial days. 1:3 or 1:2 can be the best pattern for allocation.
29. there should be a break allowed for all staffs in turns, because its difficult to sit or work continuous for 12 hour. if we would get a mid night snacks that would also help a lot in terms of refreshment.
