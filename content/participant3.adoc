1. done
2. yes
3. yes, i'm happy and satisfied by my work.
4. evening, Because I do not have to get up in the morning, I get enough sleep, and even after duty I do not have to wake up in the night, I sleep comfortably.
5. Night shift doesn't feel so bad, but before joining the job, I was very excited for night duty, but now when I have to do 2 night shifts every week, it doesn't feel that good.
6. Yes, there is a rule too, that's why I am doing night shift every week, otherwise I would just do it sometimes not every week.
7. Nothing much, I get a little headache and I find it a problem to cook food after coming from night.
8. not much
9. no no, nothing to social life.
10. for me there is no such problem for family i manage by calling them time to time. 
11. for married people there might be some issues.
12. sleeping pattern is being changed every 2nd day because of rotating shift.
13. sometimes just after night shifts.
14. no no, not much affect because as a student also i was not sleeping on time. rather now i feel more forced to sleep on time to maintain my shift works.
15. There is no problem in appetite, hunger seems to be with time but there is no time to eat food.
16. no, i never felt any hormonal issues yet.
17. no, i would not call it psychological issue but there is little irritation.
18. mood becomes irritable when night shift comes, i starts getting rude sometimes, maybe because of tiredest and incomplete sleep.
19. N/A
20. yActually we should get 8 hours of sleep. Which is not possible in the sharing room.
21. no, According to the situation in front, that alertness comes.
22. no no, i don't think night shift can affect our performance,.
23. no, not at all, everyone stays very serious about patient safety always.
24. no, we become attentive automatically, i never had such experience.
25. yeah, the major effect is that it consumes our time so much.
26. no, i don't find any benefit of doing night shift. we are getting a night off after doing 2 night shifts but that's totally useless and it goes only for sleeping, there is difference in day off and night off and day off is useful.
27. maybe yes, if i would get a chance to get only day shifts i will definitively choose that.
28. yes, as such if we can get more staffs for night shift and can allocate less patients per staff like 2:1, it will bw better. some mid night snacks or strong coffee would help a lot. as in some Government sectors there is a nurses station in each ward and during night sisters can take rest while other sisters would assist patients interchangeably.
