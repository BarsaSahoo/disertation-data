1. done
2. yes
3. yes, but there is little pressure in this work.
4. evening, because we can take food properly on time during this shift.
5. night shift is of 12 hours, so there is problem in having food on time and also the work load is continuous, without taking rest for 12 hours.
6. no, its the rule here to do atleast 2 night shifts per week, that's why.
7. yes of course it shortens, i'm married and i have a daughter, i can't simply return from night shift and sleep, i have to cook, do household works, make breakfast lunch for husband and daughter, its difficult to complete sleep.
8. by god's grace my husband and my in laws supports me so from that side its ok, but one very painful thing is that i can't participate in events or programs and because of this my daughter also have to miss everything because my husband also works.
9. we are Bengalis and we have most of the family events during night, and every week there will be night shift so i miss many of the events.
10. i request our in-charge to adjust my roaster, many times i have done 4 nights continuous so that for next week i can be free during night just to participate in family functions.
11. actually me and my husband works in same hospital so there is not that big issues, because atleast he can understand this hospitals situations. but many of my friends always complains who's husbands are not in medical area that, they never understands what its like to work whole night.
12. its not only night shift affects our sleeping pattern, every shift equally affects sleeping pattern.
13. yes, because i can't complete my sleep. when its the evening shift after night off i feel sleepy. in whole week we get one day off that is after night, my daughter expects from us to visit some places or go out for movie or to relatives house, we have to do that atleast for her, so we can't rest during the day. so obviously this will happen.
14. yes fully disturbed it is, in nursing profession we can't have a specific sleep awake cycle.
15. yes, we can't eat on time, its always in a different time than when we are exactly hungry.
16. yes, i have hormonal issue we'll have because we can't drink enough water and the lack in sleep is always there.
17. yes the pressure of work and helplessness for my family makes me exhausted some times i even feel depressed, but because of my husband's support i'm able to manage.
18. i am able to stay calm only to see my daughter's happiness otherwise this much effort won't be worth it.
19. yes, i got to know about my hormonal issues because of that only, i started having irregular and delayed periods after few months of joining this job and i met to gynecologist. i have to stay conscious about my fluid intake timings and also about my diet, i still have to go for follow ups.
20. actually it depends on my work which i can do during day when i have night shift, such as going to market for grocery and all. so i manage to sleep for 4-5 hours.
21. in earlier days it may affect if we are not careful enough, after some experience i don't think it can affect.
22. no, my performance remains same.
23. night shift is just a shift, it can't affect safety of patient.
24. no, this many years i have worked but till date i never had such experience.
25. my daughter is young now she have school, tuition and all so i am not able to give her that much time, that's the major effect in my life.
26. there is no benefit of doing night shift is nothing here in india.
27. yes maybe people can leave job if they get other option like having a job with only day shifts.
28. yes, it increases the pressure. see now there its christmas season, many sisters are on leave there is little more pressure in work. it happens during festivals like during durga pooja we want to take leave but we can barely get leave for maximum 2-3 days because everyone wants to enjoy so they can't grant leave for everyone together. in neuro-surgery icu if craniotomy or cranioplasty post operative patient is there, sister can't handle more than one patient.
29. staffing pattern should be flexible. according to department and condition of the patient staffing pattern should be maintained. there should not be shortage of staff. extra staff for supervision should be provided so that sisters can 30 minutes of break. continuous 12 hour working shift can't be done in ease. by 2 am morning it feels so tired maybe a hot coffee would help during winters.
