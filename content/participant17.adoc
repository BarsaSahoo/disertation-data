1. done
2. yes,
3. yes, i love my profession.
4. morning, because in morning shift the benefit in duty is that all senior staffs and doctors are available, the doctors round and doing pre-op for patients, medicines and all takes the whole shift so it ends very fast. then after shift i get my personal time too.
5. night is the worst shift among all shifts, because there are many problems such as, there won't be available consultant doctors, no seniors will be there to guide if there is any emergency, so its difficult.
6. no, its because its a rule here.
7. in our hospital night shift is of 12 hours, so working for 12 hours a really big thing. there can be 3-4 patients under one sister, i will complete my work but by 2am i'll feel sleepy anyway because its night, no matter how much i slept during the day, its common to feel sleepy during night. but, i have patients responsibility, anytime anything can go wrong with my patient so i have to be cautious. because of prolonged sitting i have back pain all the time and constipation is very common for me to have during night shifts. my shift will be over by 8am and i'll reach my room by 9am, even if i'll manage my morning routine and breakfast in one hour and sleep by 10 am, i'll atleast sleep till 3-4pm, so where day went i can't see.
8. during night shift for those 2 days i don't know what's going on in my family, because 12 hours night i'm working, day time i'm sleeping and after that again i'm preparing for duty only. so for 2 days either i'm sleeping or i'm on duty, and i can't do anything to solve it.
9. the invitation for events won't come according to my shift right, so i also have this issues in maintaining social relations here, because i can't attend many such events because when ever i get a little i run for visiting my family because i miss my mom.
10. by saying the truth, and giving as much as time i can give.
11. in married life there will be more problems in initial time i think, parents understands our situations but the spouse may not understand that well. from my side also i know what my mother and father's health condition is and what possible problems they can have so i can guide them on phone as well, but if there is baby in my life i can't predict what problems can arise so i'll have to available for them also. so, there will be many more problems i think.
12. sleep pattern is being changed every 2nd day with the changing shift.
13. no, except the just next morning when i return from night shift, i never had such experience.
14. before joining this job i had a sleep awake cycle which now no more exists.
15. actually appetite is being disturbed in such a way, like i can't eat when i'm hungry as the time of having my meal changes every 2nd day with my changing shift. today i have morning shift i'll return to room by 2:30pm and have lunch by 3:30 - 4pm but on next day if i have evening shift i'll have my lunch by 12:30pm because i have to reach here by 1pm and so on for the night shift, different time of meal.
16. i have experienced hormonal disturbances resulting in my digestion and in my mood.
17. disturbed sleep won't let us keep calm, we may behave normal but from inside those 2 days it feels like i don't know this world.
18. mood remains irritable when i know that i have to stay awake whole night even after sleeping for 7-8hours during the day and my body won't support me whole night to work.
19. n/a
20. on the 1st night i don't need any preparation, even if i try i won't get sleep. on the 2nd day after returning from night shift i directly go to bed and sleep atleast for 6-7 hours and that helps for me.
21. yes, it can happen. if i'm not attentive enough because of tiredness and lack of sleep, i can miss some communication or order got from someone or i may not understand that clearly because of sleepiness.
22. i think it can affect, because if my body is struggling of course it will be evident in my work. 
23. it can affect for sure if we won't pay attention.
24. i never experienced such experience yet, i struggle a lot to maintain this vigilance that is for sure, but i'm able to manage.
25. major negative effect i would say it includes all types of physical problems like bladder bowel disturbance, acidity and indigestion and also unhappy mood resulting from those physical disturbances. 
26. no personally there is no benefit.
27. yes, people can, even i will leave if i'll get better opportunity.
28. yes it increases the pressure, if my capacity is of handling 2 patient and i'm getting 3-4 patients, its really difficult to manage. ideally there should be 1:1 allocation in ICU.
29. during night shift there should be 2 staff for one patient so that 1 can guide the patient for 6 hours and other can do it for next 6 hours and they both can rest in turn, or they should divide night shift into short hours of shifts like 3 shifts of 4 hours so that without any break sisters could work comfortably and go, or for staying awake they can provide tea coffee everyone has used during there student life for staying awake during nights for studying.
