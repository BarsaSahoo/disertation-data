1. done
2. yes, its my choice.
3. no, because we work a lot but no body knows that, everyone remembers the doctors only and the salary is also very unsatisfactory.
4. evening, because in this shift we can do everything in a very organized way, nothing will get disturbed. i cane wake up easy in the morning, fresh up, cook and have breakfast and lunch on time then come for duty and return by 8:30pm and have dinner and good sleep.
5. feel good or bad but we have to do night shift because in hospital setting we have to work both day and night. but yes sometimes its very irritating to do night shift because its 12 hours. 
6. yes, and also because its a rule. if there will be option of choosing shift not every week but sometimes i would choose.
7. night shift takes a lot of time, because we have to complete our sleep.
8. during night shifts we can't communicate to anyone, during morning and evening shift we can only give time to all the relations.
9. in entire week we get an off day that's the night off, we get it after 2 nights and its literally useless we only can sleep on that day. so social life like enjoying with friends or going out for even a movie is not possible. we plan on some holiday off to take a leave and request our in-charge to grant us leave on same day its rarely possible to get that. so, night shift indirectly disturbs our social life so much.
10. we can inform on the day of 1st night shift about our duty, and we can talk to family after night shifts during morning and evening shifts. i do like this only.
11. in married life there will be more issues regarding family. now we can go back after work cook or buy food eat and can take rest for full 8 hours but many married sisters say that, after shift they have to prepare food for family and children, do laundry and many household works. we can feel their problems. it will be very tough for a mother or father to maintain the love, affection and responsibility for children and family with shift work.
12. during night shift also we feel sleepy between 12-2am. sleep time is not that disturbed in long term.
13. yes, i feel very sleepy during the day just after night shifts.
14. yes, initially i didn't had any such fixed sleep awake time but still now its the worst. there is no sleep awake cycle, i only sleep by looking at the watch to maintain shift timing.
15. yes, during night shifts we have to come for duty before 8pm, how can i have dinner by 7 -7:30 pm and stay awake for whole night. if i bring dinner then, i can only eat after 12am because before that patients may ask for some assistance, and when i am having late night dinner its not being digest and i am having acidity.
16. no, i never felt as such. 
17. no, we can't call it psychological issue.
18. when my sleep is not complete, i won't feel good in anything and i'll be irritated.
19. n/a
20. we should complete 8 hours of sleep before coming for night shift.
21. no no, i don't think.
22. no, it never affected my performance towards patient.
23. for patients we are here to care about, and there won't be any disturbances in that. if i feel sick i ask other staffs to assist my patient and i take a break but i never had let any negligence regarding patient safety.
24. no, never.
25. sleep is being disturbed, and i feel very weak and tired after night shift.
26. no, there is no benefit.
27. no, i don't think. if someone can't do night shift then they should not choose this profession. 
28. yes, poor staffing pattern worsens the night shifts. if staff patient ratio will be 1:2 then its good.
29. actually when i have a stable patient who is sleeping peacefully and his vitals are stable then i will complete the paper works by 11:30pm and i'll have to simply sit till 3am, i will definitely feel sleepy in such case if there will be extra helping staffs just to sit in front of my patient for 20-30 minutes then i can take a break. and its only possible when there is more than sufficient staffs, or if i have a very critical patient who needs continuous supervision then also i'll complete my paper work by 11.30 pm and i'll have to stay awake and supervise my patient for entire night so, in this case there is no option of taking break but i have to stay awake and attentive. in this type of situation we should get something like coffee or tea which can help in staying awake.
