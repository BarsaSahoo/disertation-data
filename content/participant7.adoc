5. its ok, in winters its little tough otherwise its ok.
6. yes, but if there was any other option then i would never do night shift.
7. all day goes only in sleeping. it obviously shorten the life.
8. we can't manage we can only make time for phone calls. we stay very far from our home so we rarely visit.
9. it affects, like we can plan anything together not even an outing with friends as everyone will have different shifts, we have to cancel many things because of changing shifts or we'll have to plan without some of our friends that's painful because we are the only family here for each other.

25. i become weak after my night shift and i have acidity issues, thats the major issue for me.
26. i don't think there is any benefit of doing night shift. there is an off day we get after night shift but that is useless because it goes for sleeping.

28. in ICUs there is always critical patients, so we can't handle more than 2 patients as they need continuos supervision. in case of neuro patients only one patient per staff should be allocated.
29. after finishing all work if patient is stable then we should be allowed to take 30 minutes break, and its only possible is staff is sufficient. for 12 hours we can't work or sit in front of a patient continuously. if management will keep eyes on staffing pattern and could give some mid night snacks, it would help us a lot.
