= Have you ever faced vigilance trouble because of night shifts, please share your experiences ?

== Participant 1
yet, i've never had any trouble in vigilance during night shift or because of the night shift.

== Participant 2
Yes, as once I had a paper exchange by mistake, if I had not seen it at the right time, then what a big inconvenience it could have been. There are so many differences in the condition of each patient, their vitals and intake output could have made them worse.

== Participant 16
yes, i have some experiences of trouble in vigilance, in the beginning i had maybe twice this error during night shift, i wrote the handover and by mistake i put those critical charts on the table of different patients.

== Participant 17
i never experienced such experience yet, i struggle a lot to maintain this vigilance that is for sure, but i'm able to manage.

== Participant 18
no, i never had any such experience yet.

== Participant 19
i have experiences of minor mistakes in paper works if i could not complete my sleep during the day or if there is any health issue during night shift.

== Participant 20
yes, when there is pressure i had done silly mistakes which can really cause serious problems, and it only happens in night shifts because during night its only and only you who has to take care of everything. once i had 2 patients and one vacant bed at night, one of those patients was in ventilator i was already stressed and working continuous for both of the patients then on my vacant bed a new patient got admitted and was in serious condition that we had to put that patient in ventilator just then and all initial ICU profile works i had to do plus my old patients were there, that day i wrote hand over on the critical chart nicely but kept the papers on wrong patients table, it got exchanged by my mistake. so, it happens because there won't be any helping hand or guide during night even to catch our mistakes so night shift is very tough.
